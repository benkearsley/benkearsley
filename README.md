### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Ben and I'm an undergraduate statistics student at Brigham Young University.  I have a keen interest in data science, and am also pursuing studies in mathematics and business strategy.  I'm new to GitHub, but excited to learn more about Git and expand my portfolio of work.

I currently work for a data science firm in the consumer goods retail industry.  I also am doing research with a neuroscience professor at Brigham Young University studying brain waves and seizures.
